# AWDD (Automated Wildfire Detection Drone)
AWDD was a project launched by 4 of us in order to help firefighters predict and react quicker to wildfires in California. After 2 months, we expanded our scope to other regions that fell victim to wildfires (ie. Australia).
The code in this repository was sample prototype code that was developed for the first model drone we made during 3 years of high school.
